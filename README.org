* Learning Terraform


From [[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmxkYNv1ksg][here]].


** What
   
Terraform is declarative - declare what you want - terraform does the rest.

For examples, say you want a VM, Azure in a VPC. With Terraform we would write code to describe the VM, Azure and VPC in file. You would then use Terraform to deploy.

First we would "plan", this would compare desired outcome to what currently exists. For example, on Day 1, everything would be created.

Then we ca "apply". Here Terraform works with API tokens to spin up your services.

Terra form is pluggable so can work with IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

Terraform is devops first which allows for best practice and avoids config drift.
